       "1822      this product is now garbage aubreys death was very unfortunate because im sure he is turning in his grave if he knew how his children have completely and utterly disgraced his product line with garbage ingredients two nights ago i did my usual routine and purchased the honeysuckle rose conditioner from my local whole foods i was using the product as usual that night and as i was working it through my hair i noticed a major difference in how the product felt and how it was affecting my hair the reason i have so loved the honeysuckle rose conditioner was because it was the only conditioner among many that i have tried that left my hair feeling moisturized bouncy curly smooth and overall rejuvenated i immediately noticed a difference when i was using this new bottle on my hair something in my mind told me to pick up my old bottle that i had in the shower and the new bottle i had just purchased the bottles looked the same but the ingredients and labeling are radically different the old bottle says 100natural no parabens or petrochemicals while the new bottle only says all natural ingredients the old bottle has the following ingredientscoconut fatty acid cream base organic aloe vera organic shea butter wheat germ oil organic jojoba oil organic rosa mosqueta rose hip seed oil extracts of fennel hops balm mint mistletoe camomile yarrow chrysanthemum angelica forsythia and magnolia honeysuckle oil carrot oil aubreys preservative citrus seed extract vitamins a c and ethe new bottle has these ingredientsaqua cetyl alcohol alcohol denat 38b lavender butyrospermum parkii shea butter triticum vulgare wheat germ oil lonicera caprifolium honeysuckle extract aloe barbadensis aloe leaf juice glycerin simmondsia chinensis jojoba seed oil rosa rubignosa rosa mosqueta seed oil citrus grandis grapefruit extract tocopheryl acetate foeniculum vulgare fennel fruit extract humulus lupulus hops extract melissa officinalis balm mint leaf extract chamomilla recutita matricaria extract glycine soja soybean oil daucus carota sativa carrot root extract betacarotene hamamelis virginiana witch hazel water angelica archangelica extract chrysanthemum sinense flower extract magnolia biondii flower extract ascorbic acid organicthi is a total change in formula and a huge change in the effectiveness of the product i am incredibly disappointed that aubrey has decided to reduce their product to such garbageand still charge the same price and drag the aubrey name in the dirt aubrey organics has long been known for selling pure and natural products and have now reduced themselves to insulting its consumers and long time supporters of the brand name by selling low quality products for the same price i am willing to pay good money for quality products but i cannot stress enough how much it infuriates me to have to pay a high price for poisoning unnatural garbage ingredients  the old formula did great things for my hair and in my line of work i have recommended it to many customers who have asked me what is the best conditioner based on their hair type and i have always steered them toward aubrey knowing that i was recommending a great product now it embarrasses me to know that i may have led people to buy what i thought was a great product but what i now know is new garbage it makes me look like a liar and im offended that aubrey would change their formula to something so cheap and not inform their customers i hope the people at aubrey take note and that other users of the brand speak out against this new horrible change and low standard of products from aubreysincerely froma hurt frustrated and enraged former consumer\n",
